Inside generate_poem() there lies a variable, max_syls which defines the line with the most syllables.
The line with the most syllable is the middle most, and we add lines with 2 less syllables on both over and under the middle line.
This is repeated until a line with at least 3 syllables is reached.
Inspired by haikus which are 5-7-5, we have similar structure but expanded.
For example, if max_syls is 7, the poem will be 3-5-7-5-3.
For the sake of the examples I kept it at a maximum of 7.
